# Proto
Chicken - A 2D platformer that I am working on in order to further develop my game developer abilities.
Steak - A 3D action game; same reason mentioned earlier at 'Chicken'.

SaveManager - personal C# and batch project that I and my colleagues will use on a day to day basis during our working hours.
(A piece of software that helps managinc the export, import and delete actions of an xbox, ps4 or nsw console. 
This is WIP and cannot be treated as a fully usable product until all platforms are supported. 
This is for personal use only and does not contain all the external components that would make the program work as intended.)
